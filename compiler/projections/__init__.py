"""
Projection types and abstractions.

Each projection is a deterministic derivation of the PIRGraph —
the sole semantic authority. No projection derives from another
projection. All derive from Graph.

Projection families:

    canonical   — human/governance/tooling authority (protocol_snapshot/)
    tokenized   — machine/silicon/runtime authority (tokenized_snapshot/)
    vocabulary  — debug/trace/symbol substrate (semantic_vocabulary/)
    evidence    — observability/replay (evidence_snapshot/)
    dispatch    — token-native execution routing (tokenized_snapshot/)
    handlers    — token-native implementation dispatch (tokenized_snapshot/)

Foundational doctrine:
    - Single semantic authority (PIRGraph)
    - Multiple deterministic sibling projections
    - Governance reasons in symbolic semantic space
    - Tokenization is machine realization space
    - Semantic Space vs Address Space separation is absolute
    - S8 validates based on ProjectionClass, never by filename
